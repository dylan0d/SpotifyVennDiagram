# SpotifyVennDiagram
Takes 2 playlists and creates a venn diagram of shared songs, in theory

It just outputs the sets Playlist1/Playlist2, Playlist2/Playlist1 and Playlist1âˆ©Playlist2 to the terminal
and also to a nice[citation needed] little Venn Diagram.

If you have python at all and TKinter then this should be fine. If not then it won't run but you're not missing
out on much tbh, not sure how you found this in the first place really.
