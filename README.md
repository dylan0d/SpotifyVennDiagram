# SpotifyVennDiagram
Takes 2 playlists and creates a Venn diagram of shared songs, in theory

It just outputs the sets Playlist1/Playlist2, Playlist2/Playlist1 and Playlist1âˆ©Playlist2 to the terminal
and also to a nice[citation needed] little Venn Diagram.

If you have python at all and TKinter then this should be fine. If you don't then you can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and then get TKinter using the instructions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

Simply run the program in the terminal and follow the instruction. You'll need a spotify account but it doesn't have to be premium, and it helps to have the URIs of the playlists and their owners handy.
